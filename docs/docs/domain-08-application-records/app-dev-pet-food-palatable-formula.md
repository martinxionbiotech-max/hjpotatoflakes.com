**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-07-19

---

## 1. Customer Requirement

### 1.1 Customer Profile
- **Company:** Leading US-based premium pet food brand
- **Market Position:** Top-5 in US natural/superpremium pet food segment
- **Product Lines:** Grain-free kibble, freeze-raw coated bites, and wet/chunk formulations
- **Annual Volume:** Approximately 180,000 tons pet food annually across 3 production facilities
- **Distribution:** Independent pet retailers (60%), e-commerce (30%), veterinary clinics (10%)

### 1.2 Initial Specification Request

The customer requested the development of **two distinct potato-based palatant/binder systems** — one optimized for feline palatability, one for canine palatability:

| Requirement | Detail |
|:---|---|
| Target species | Cat (feline) formulation — high-protein palatant basis |
| | Dog (canine) formulation — high-carbohydrate energy basis |
| Primary function | Palatability enhancement (first-bite preference), digestibility, kibble structure |
| Base ingredient | Potato flakes and/or potato flour — clean label, grain-free compatible |
| Key performance metric | Palatability preference test (2-bowl vs. control): ≥65% first-choice preference |
| Secondary metric | In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) ≥80% for both formulations |
| Regulatory | AAFCO 2024, FDA GRAS, non-GMO, no artificial flavors or synthetic binders |
| Volume estimate | Cat formulation: 300–500 MT/year; Dog formulation: 500–800 MT/year |

### 1.3 Market Context

The US pet food market reached $56 billion in 2025, with the premium segment growing at 8.2% CAGR. Potato-derived ingredients have become a cornerstone of grain-free pet food formulations, valued for their:
- Highly digestible starch (>90% in vitro digestibility when properly gelatinized)
- Low allergenicity (potato is not among the top-10 pet food allergens)
- Clean-label positioning (simple, recognizable ingredient)
- Natural binder functionality in kibble extrusion

However, feline and canine palatability preferences differ significantly. Cats are obligate carnivores with strong umami/amino-acid preferences; dogs are facultative carnivores with broader acceptance of carbohydrate-based palatants. A one-size-fits-all approach is suboptimal.

### 3.4 Sample Preparation Protocol

#### Common Steps (Both Formulas)

1. **Base kibble production:** Chicken-based (40% chicken meal, 30% potato blend, 15% peas, 10% chicken fat, 5% vitamins/minerals); extrusion at 120°C barrel temperature, 50°C die head, 3 mm diameter
2. **Drying:** 100°C for 20 min → target moisture 8–10%
3. **Palatant coating preparation:** Dry blend (potato flakes + hydrolysates/digests) + warm fat/oil (55°C) mixed in batch coater
4. **External coating application:** Spray onto kibble in rotating drum coater (120 s at 15 rpm)
5. **Final drying:** Air-dried at 40°C for 10 min
6. **Packaging:** Sealed in metallized film, N₂-flushed, stored at 20°C

#### Feline-Specific Coating

- Inline spray: Liquid salmon oil applied first (5% w/w)
- Dry powder coating: Potato flakes (60%) + chicken liver hydrolysate (15%) + brewer's yeast (8%) + taurine (0.5%) + remaining carrier balance (16.5%)

#### Canine-Specific Coating

- Inline spray: Warm beef fat applied first (8% w/w)
- Dry powder coating: Potato flakes (40%) + potato flour (27%) + chicken digest (6%) + potato protein concentrate (5%) + remaining carrier balance (22%)

### 3.5 Replication

All formulations tested in triplicate production runs. Palatability testing used n = 20 cats and n = 20 dogs (individually housed, acclimated 7 days, two-bowl tests over 3 consecutive days). In vitro digestibility testing in triplicate.

---

## 4. Test Data Tables

### 4.1 Feline Palatability — Two-Bowl Preference Test

**Protocol:** Cats offered two bowls simultaneously (Test = potato-based palatant; Control = standard commercial cat kibble). Consumption measured over 2 h. First-choice visit recorded. Test conducted for 3 consecutive days, positions randomized daily.

| Formulation (Test) | First-Choice Preference (Test %) | Consumption Ratio (Test/Total %) | Statistically Significant? |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Control (no potato coating) | 48% | 51% | n.s. (baseline) |
| F-01: 50% flakes + 5% hydrolysate | 58% | 62% | n.s. |
| F-02: 60% flakes + 10% hydrolysate | 67% | 70% | p < 0.05 |
| **F-03: 60% flakes + 15% hydrolysate** | **72%** | **76%** | **p < 0.01** |
| F-04: 70% flakes + 15% hydrolysate | 65% | 68% | p < 0.05 |
| F-05: 60% flakes + 20% hydrolysate | 68% | 72% | p < 0.05 |

**Selected: F-03 (60% potato flakes + 15% chicken liver hydrolysate + 5% salmon oil).**
This formulation achieved **72% first-choice** and **76% consumption ratio** — exceeding the customer's 65% threshold.

### 4.2 Canine Palatability — Two-Bowl Preference Test

**Protocol:** Identical protocol to feline test but using dogs. Control = standard commercial dog kibble (grain-free, potato-based from another supplier).

| Formulation (Test) | First-Choice Preference (Test %) | Consumption Ratio (Test/Total %) | Statistically Significant? |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Control (no potato coating) | 49% | 52% | n.s. (baseline) |
| D-01: 100:0 flakes:flour + 5% fat | 55% | 58% | n.s. |
| D-02: 80:20 flakes:flour + 8% fat | 62% | 65% | n.s. |
| **D-03: 60:40 flakes:flour + 8% fat** | **69%** | **72%** | **p < 0.01** |
| D-04: 40:60 flakes:flour + 8% fat | 66% | 68% | p < 0.05 |
| D-05: 60:40 flakes:flour + 11% fat | 70% | 74% | p < 0.01 |

**Selected: D-03 (60:40 flakes:flour, 8% beef fat, 6% chicken digest).**
This formulation achieved **69% first-choice** and **72% consumption ratio** — exceeding the 65% target. D-05 showed marginally higher preference (70%) but the extra 3% fat was deemed unnecessary for palatability success and increased calorie density undesirably.

### 4.3 In Vitro Dry Matter Digestibility (IVDMD)

IVDMD measured using the modified Tilley & Terry method (2-stage: pepsin/HCl at 39°C for 6 h, then pancreatin/amylase at 39°C for 18 h).

| Sample | IVDMD (%) | Digestibility Category | Notes |
|:---|---:|:---|:---|
| Base kibble (uncoated) | 78.3 ± 1.2 | Good | — |
| **F-03 (Feline)** | **82.5 ± 0.8** | **Excellent** | Exceeds 80% threshold |
| **D-03 (Canine)** | **84.1 ± 1.0** | **Excellent** | Exceeds 80% threshold |
| Control (commercial) | 76.5 ± 1.5 | Good | — |
| Native potato flour only | 72.8 ± 1.3 | Moderate | Lower due to uncooked starch |
| Pre-gelatinized flakes only | 87.2 ± 0.9 | Excellent | Highest among all tested |

**Key observation:** The pre-gelatinized potato flakes in both F-03 and D-03 contributed significantly to the high IVDMD. Both formulations exceeded the customer's 80% minimum target by a comfortable margin.

### 4.4 Digestibility Comparison by Starch Type

| Starch Source (in kibble matrix) | Feline IVDMD (%) | Canine IVDMD (%) |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Pre-gelatinized potato flakes (only) | 87.2 ± 1.1 | 88.5 ± 0.9 |
| 60% flakes + 40% native potato flour | 82.5 ± 0.8 | 84.1 ± 1.0 |
| 100% native potato flour | 72.8 ± 1.3 | 74.2 ± 1.2 |
| Commercial reference (rice starch) | 79.5 ± 1.0 | 81.0 ± 0.8 |

The higher digestibility of potato flakes vs. native flour is attributed to complete gelatinization during drum drying, making starch granules fully accessible to digestive enzymes.

### 4.5 Kibble Physical Properties

| Parameter | Uncoated Kibble | F-03 (Feline) | D-03 (Canine) | Target |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Bulk density (g/L) | 385 | 420 | 435 | 380–450 |
| Hardness (N) — average | 38.2 | 42.5 | 44.8 | 35–55 N |
| Friability (%) | 1.8% | 1.2% | 1.0% | <3% |
| Expansion ratio | 2.8:1 | 2.6:1 | 2.5:1 | 2.0–3.0:1 |
| Water stability (min, 20°C) | 15 | 22 | 25 | >15 (for wet foods) |

**Interpretation:** Both F-03 and D-03 produced kibble with acceptable hardness and friability. The potato coating slightly increased bulk density and hardness, but all parameters remained within commercial specification ranges.

### 4.6 Gelatinization Degree Effect on Palatability

| Formulation | Gelatinization Degree (of starch fraction) | First-Choice Preference (Cat) | First-Choice Preference (Dog) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| F-03 (high gelatinization) | >95% | 72% | — |
| F-03 modified (low gelatinization) | <30% | 51% | — |
| D-03 (high gelatinization) | ~70% (blend) | — | 69% |
| D-03 modified (low gelatinization) | <20% | — | 52% |

**Conclusion:** High gelatinization degree is critical for palatability in both species — fully gelatinized starch produces a more readily digestible and thus more palatable product.

### 4.7 Comparative Performance Summary

| KPI | Feline (F-03) | Canine (D-03) | Customer Target | Status |

### 5.2 Species-Specific Palatability Drivers

| Driver | Cat (Feline) | Dog (Canine) |
|:---|---|:---|
| Primary taste preference | High umami (L-glutamate, IMP, GMP) | Fat + meaty (beef fat, chicken) |
| Critical amino acids | Taurine, arginine, methionine | Arginine, lysine, methionine |
| Preferred fat source | Fish oil (salmon) > poultry > beef | Beef fat > chicken > fish |
| Starch role | Binder + digestible energy (minor) | Energy source (major) |
| Hydrolysate need | High (obligate carnivore — lacks endogenous umami perception without peptides) | Moderate (can synthesize some umami perception) |
| Sensitivity to textures | High — prefer consistent, smooth coating | Moderate — accept broader texture range |

### 5.3 Digestibility Discussion

The in vitro digestibility results reflect three important findings:

1. **Pre-gelatinization advantage:** Potato flakes (>95% gelatinized) showed 14.4 percentage points higher IVDMD than native flour in cat formulation (87.2% vs. 72.8%). This confirms that gelatinization is the single most important driver of starch digestibility in pet food.

2. **Blended formulation performance:** The 60:40 flakes:flour blend (D-03) achieved 84.1% IVDMD — only 4.4% lower than 100% flakes in canine testing, while providing superior extrusion structure and kibble integrity.

3. **Species equivalence:** Despite the different formulation strategies, both F-03 and D-03 met the ≥80% digestibility target, confirming that potato-based formulations can achieve nutritionally adequate starch digestibility for both species.

### 5.4 Economic Analysis

| Cost Component | Feline (F-03) | Canine (D-03) |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Base ingredients (potato flakes + flour) | $0.72/kg coating | $0.68/kg coating |
| Palatant enhancers (hydrolysates, digests) | $1.80/kg coating | $1.20/kg coating |

| Other (vitamins, minerals, taurine) | $0.40/kg coating | $0.35/kg coating |
| **Total coating cost** | **$4.02/kg coating** | **$3.13/kg coating** |
| Application rate | 8% w/w | 10% w/w |
| **Cost per kg kibble (added)** | **$0.32/kg** | **$0.31/kg** |
| Premium positioning value | +$0.80–1.20/kg retail | +$0.50–0.80/kg retail |

Both formulations offer a positive return on investment when positioned as "premium, clean-label, grain-free" products.

1. **Pre-warm liquid component** (salmon oil to 45°C; beef fat to 55°C) for even atomization
2. **Apply liquid coating first** to warm kibble (50–55°C) in rotating drum — 120 seconds at 12 rpm
3. **Add dry powder coating** — continue tumbling 90 seconds at 15 rpm
4. **Heat-set coating** — 60°C forced air for 5 min to fuse coating to kibble surface
5. **Cool to ambient** before packaging (ensure <10% moisture pickup from coating)

**Recommended usage conditions:**
- Kibble temperature at coating: 50–60°C (optimal adhesion)
- Coating drum rotation: 12–15 rpm
- Dry coating particle size: d50 ≤ 250 µm for feline; d50 ≤ 350 µm for canine
