## 1. The Supply Chain Challenge

Potato processing is inherently seasonal. The harvest window for any single geographic region spans 6–10 weeks, yet flake production runs 11–12 months per year. The gap between biological seasonality and industrial demand is bridged entirely by storage technology and supply chain orchestration.

Hongji Agriculture's Zhangjiakou facility processes 180,000–220,000 metric tons of raw potatoes annually. With a single growing season in Northern China and a storage duration of 7–9 months, the company must source from multiple climate zones across China while simultaneously managing inventory drawdown, quality degradation curves, and buffer stock for supply disruptions.

This document details the procurement calendar, inventory management models, quality forecasting, and contingency planning that enable Hongji to deliver consistent potato flake quality 365 days per year.

## 2. China's Potato Growing Regions and Harvest Calendar

### 2.1 Regional Classification

Chinese potato production is divided into four primary agro-ecological zones, each with distinct growing cycles, cultivars, and quality profiles:

| Zone | Provinces | Crop Cycles | Harvest Period | % National Processing Potato | Key Cultivars |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| **Northern Single-Cropping Zone** | Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning | 1 (spring-planted) | Mid-August – Late October | 68% | Atlantic, Shepody, Russet Burbank, Kexin-1 |
| **Central Double-Cropping Zone** | Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Zhejiang | 2 (spring + autumn) | Spring: May–June; Autumn: October–November | 22% | Favorita, Kexin-18, Atlantic |
| **Southern Winter-Cropping Zone** | Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan | 1 (winter-planted) | January–April | 8% | Cooperation 88, Atlantic, Mira |
| **Southwestern Mixed Zone** | Yunnan (highland), Guizhou, Sichuan (western) | 1–2 (variable) | Variable (6–12 month cycle) | 2% | Local varieties, limited processing quality |

### 2.2 Hongji's Harvest Calendar and Supply Windows

Hongji's procurement strategy sources from three primary zones to maintain continuous raw material supply:

**Primary Supply — Northern Single-Cropping Zone (August–October):**
- **Volume:** 150,000–170,000 tons (75–80% of annual requirement)
- **Key origin:** Hongji's own contracted farms in Zhangjiakou and Ulanqab (Inner Mongolia)
- **Cultivars:** Atlantic (60%), Shepody (25%), Russet Burbank (15%)
- **Delivery window:** August 20 – October 20 (peak: September 10–30)
- **Handling:** Direct harvest-to-storage flow; stored until next harvest

**Supplementary Supply — Central Double-Cropping Zone (May–June):**
- **Volume:** 25,000–30,000 tons (12–14% of annual requirement)
- **Key origin:** Shandong (Heze, Linyi) and Henan (Kaifeng)
- **Cultivars:** Atlantic, Favorita

## 3. Hongji's Raw Material Reserve Strategy

### 3.1 Multi-Tier Inventory Model

Hongji operates a **three-tier inventory system**:

| Tier | Description | Volume (tons) | Duration of Coverage | Storage Type | Quality Specification |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1 — Active Stock** | Current production rotation | 80,000–100,000 | 3–4 months | Refrigerated cells | Dry matter ≥ 20%, RS ≤ 0.25 mg/g |
| **Tier 2 — Reserve Stock** | Strategic buffer | 40,000–60,000 | 2–3 months | CA cells | Dry matter ≥ 19%, RS ≤ 0.35 mg/g |
| **Tier 3 — Emergency Reserve** | Extreme supply disruption | 10,000–15,000 | 0.5–1 month | CA cells | Dry matter ≥ 18.5%, RS ≤ 0.45 mg/g |

**Stock Allocation Logic:**

The reserve sizing follows a Monte Carlo simulation model (100,000 iterations) that incorporates:
- Historical harvest yield variability (CV = 12–18% for Northern zone)
- Storage loss distributions (normal, μ = 5.5%, σ = 1.8%)
- Processing demand volatility (CV = 8%)
- Logistic disruption frequency (0.5 events/year, average 7-day duration)
- Price spike probability (commodity price > 25% above contract threshold)

**Target service level:** 97.5% raw material availability at all times

### 3.2 Procurement Contract Portfolio

| Contract Type | Volume (%) | Price Mechanism | Risk Allocation | Duration |
|--------------|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Fixed-Price Forward | 45% | Pre-agreed FOB price, adjusted for CPI | Buyer absorbs volume risk, seller absorbs price risk | Annual |
| Base + Bonus | 25% | Base price for standard quality; bonus for dry matter > 21%, reducing sugars < 0.15% | Shared incentive for quality | Annual |
| Market-Linked | 20% | 80% of market reference price ± quality premium | Shared price and volume risk | Annual |
| Spot Purchases | 10% | Daily market price | Buyer takes all market risk | Per-load |

## 4. Inventory Turnover Model

### 4.1 Process Flow and Inventory Dynamics

Hongji's raw material flow follows a **First-In, First-Stored (FIFS)** / **First-In, Quality-Assessed (FIQA)** model, where quality takes precedence over age for processing order:

```
Northern Harvest (Sep-Oct)
    │
    ▼
Tier 1 Active (Refrigerated, 7-10°C)
    │
    ├──► Processed Nov-Feb (prime quality window)
    │
    ├──► Downgraded to Tier 2 Reserve after Month 5
    │
    ├──► Drain Down ●
    │
    ▼
Tier 2 Reserve (CA, 7-8°C)
    │
    ├──► Processed Mar-Jun (acceptable quality)
    │
    ├──► Downgraded to Tier 3 if quality holding
    │
    ▼
Tier 3 Emergency Reserve (CA, 8°C)
    │
    └──► Processed only when fresh or Tier 2 depleted
```

### 4.2 Inventory Turnover Calculation

**Key Performance Indicators:**

| Metric | Target | Formula | Current Benchmark |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------|
| Inventory Turns (Raw) | 1.1–1.2× annual | (Annual processing volume) / (Average inventory) | 1.15× |
| Material Utilization Rate | ≥ 94% | (Tons processed)/(Tons received + carryover) | 93.5% |
| Average Dwell Time | 185 days (6.1 months) | ∑(Tons-days)/∑(Tons) | 192 days |
| Quality Decay Rate | ≤ 0.015 mg/g/month RS increase | Linear regression of monthly RS data | 0.012 mg/g/month |
| Shrinkage Rate | ≤ 5.5% | (Losses)/(Total diverts + losses) | 5.8% |

### 4.3 Dynamic Drawdown Algorithm

Processing order is determined by a weighted scoring system:

```
Priority Score = w₁ × (Age Score) + w₂ × (Quality Score) + w₃ × (Storage Cost Score) + w₄ × (Demand Match Score)

Where:
- Age Score = Max(0, 1 — (months_in_storage / 9))  (older = lower score = process sooner)
- Quality Score = Dry Matter / 20 + (0.35 — RS) / 0.35  (higher DM, lower RS = higher score)
- Storage Cost Score = 1 — (storage_cost_per_month / max_storage_cost)
- Demand Match Score = 1 — |target_DM — actual_DM| / 2  (closer to product spec = higher score)
- w₁ = 0.30, w₂ = 0.40, w₃ = 0.10, w₄ = 0.20  (weights determined by regression on 3-year data)
```

The algorithm is executed weekly, producing a prioritized drawdown schedule for each storage cell.

## 5. Quality Deterioration Curves and Shelf-Life Prediction

### 5.1 Degradation Kinetics

Potato quality during storage follows a complex degradation pattern that is both temperature-dependent and cultivar-specific. Hongji uses empirically-derived kinetic models to predict quality at any point in the storage cycle.

**Reducing Sugar (RS) Accumulation Model:**

```
RS(t) = RS₀ + k × tⁿ

Where:
- RS(t) = reducing sugars at time t (mg/g FW)
- RS₀ = initial reducing sugars (mg/g FW) at day 45 post-harvest
- k = rate constant (cultivar-specific)
- n = shape parameter (typically 1.2–1.5 for low-temperature storage)
- t = storage time (days after curing)
```

**Parameter Values (Hongji empirical data, 2023–2025):**

| Cultivar | RS₀ (mg/g) | k (×10⁻³) | n | R² | Valid Range (Days) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| Atlantic (7°C) | 0.12 | 0.42 | 1.38 | 0.94 | 45–270 |
| Atlantic (10°C) | 0.10 | 0.28 | 1.25 | 0.92 | 45–270 |
| Shepody (7°C) | 0.14 | 0.51 | 1.42 | 0.93 | 45–240 |
| Shepody (10°C) | 0.12 | 0.35 | 1.30 | 0.91 | 45–240 |
| Russet Burbank (7°C) | 0.10 | 0.38 | 1.35 | 0.95 | 45–270 |

### 5.2 Shelf-Life Definition

Hongji defines raw material **shelf-life** as the period during which stored potatoes remain capable of producing flake product meeting Grade A specifications:

| Cultivar | Maximum Safe Storage (months) | Limiting Factor | Risk at Shelf-Life Expiry |
|----------|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Atlantic | 8–9 | Reducing sugar accumulation | Flake color L* < 82 |
| Shepody | 7–8 | Reducing sugar + texture loss | Paste viscosity reduction > 15% |
| Russet Burbank | 8–10 | Dormancy release, sprouting | Weight loss > 8% |
| General Mix | 7 (for export-grade spec) | RS > 0.30 mg/g | Non-compliant for Japan/EU |

### 5.3 Monthly Quality Projection Matrix

| Month of Storage | Expected DM (%) | Expected RS (mg/g) | Flake Color L* | Tuber Firmness (N) | Processing Suitability |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Month 1 (Nov) | 21.0–22.0 | 0.10–0.15 | 88–92 | 90–100 | Premium |
| Month 2 (Dec) | 20.8–21.8 | 0.12–0.18 | 87–91 | 88–98 | Premium |
| Month 3 (Jan) | 20.5–21.5 | 0.14–0.20 | 86–90 | 85–95 | Premium |
| Month 4 (Feb) | 20.2–21.2 | 0.16–0.23 | 85–89 | 82–92 | Premium–Standard |
| Month 5 (Mar) | 20.0–21.0 | 0.18–0.27 | 84–88 | 79–90 | Standard |
| Month 6 (Apr) | 19.5–20.5 | 0.22–0.32 | 83–87 | 76–88 | Standard |
| Month 7 (May) | 19.0–20.0 | 0.26–0.38 | 82–86 | 72–85 | Standard–Marginal |
| Month 8 (Jun) | 18.5–19.5 | 0.30–0.42 | 80–84 | 68–82 | Marginal |

*Note: Projections for Atlantic at 8°C, 92% RH. Actual values vary ±10% with initial quality and seasonal variation.*

| Price spike (> 50% above contract) | 8–12% | Seasonal | Financial, not physical | Medium |
| Export crop failure (e.g., EU frost) | 5% | 3–6 months | Demand surge | Medium–High |

### 6.2 Tiered Response Framework

**Level 1 — Minor Disruption (Supply gap < 5,000 tons):**
- Activate Tier 3 emergency reserve (10,000–15,000 tons available)
- Shift processing blend ratios (higher proportion of stored material)
- Reduce production rate by ≤ 15% if needed

**Level 2 — Moderate Disruption (Supply gap 5,000–20,000 tons):**
- Activate Tier 2 and Tier 3 reserve stocks
- Source from unaffected zone at spot premium (up to 20% premium)
- Temporary processing rate reduction (15–25%)
- Temporary product specification relaxation (domestic flake only)

**Level 3 — Severe Disruption (Supply gap > 20,000 tons):**
- Full reserve consumption
- Maximum spot procurement from all available zones
- Negotiated advance delivery from contracted suppliers (with penalty)
- Import raw material: Current options include US Pacific NW (Feb–Jun), Canada (year-round), EU (Sep–Dec)
- Production prioritized: Export contracts first → Premium domestic → Standard domestic
- Processing rate reduction 25–40%
