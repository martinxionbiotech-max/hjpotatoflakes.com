## 3. Parameter-by-Parameter Interpretation

### 3.1 Physical Properties

| Parameter | Analytical Method | What It Tells the Buyer | Red Flags |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Moisture (%)** | AOAC 934.06 (oven drying) | Determines yield, shelf life, microbiological stability. High moisture (>8.5%) = shorter shelf life, potential mold; low moisture (<5.5%) = overdried, may have reduced RR | >8.5%: request extended shelf-life data; <5.5%: test rehydration |
| **Particle Size D50 (μm)** | Sieve analysis (HJ-QA-010) | Median particle diameter indicates texture and hydration behavior. Higher D50 = coarser texture; lower = smoother | Values outside spec may cause clumping, uneven mixing, or off-spec mouthfeel in customer's product |
| **Particle Size D90 (μm)** | Sieve analysis | Maximum particle size. High D90 indicates oversized particles that may cause gritty texture | >2500 μm: may require re-milling by buyer |
| **Bulk Density (Loose/Tapped)** | ASTM D1895 | Influences packaging density, transport cost, and volumetric dosing. Low loose BD = high air entrapment = more packaging volume per kg | Significant deviation from historical average may indicate altered process conditions |
| **Color (L\*a\*b\*)** | CIELAB (D65/10°) | Visual consistency indicator. L\* reflects whiteness; a\* indicates browning; b\* measures yellowness. Critical for brand-consistent finished product | ΔE > 3.0 from buyer's reference: may cause visible difference in finished product |
| **Dark Particles** | Manual sorting (HJ-QA-010) | Visible quality metric. Higher counts = raw material quality issues or process debris | >20/250g: often triggers customer complaint |
| **Whiteness (W_G)** | Ganz whiteness formula | Important for white-sauce, beverage, and bakery applications | <75: may produce off-white final product color |

### 3.2 Chemical Properties

| Parameter | Analytical Method | What It Tells the Buyer | Red Flags |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Dry Matter (%)** | AOAC 934.06 | Inverse of moisture; 92–94% DM means 6–8% moisture | <91.5% DM: microbial stability risk |
| **Starch (% DM)** | ISO 10520 (Ewers) | Core functional component. Determines thickening power, water binding. | <68% DM: reduced yield in customer's thickening application |
| **Reducing Sugars (%)** | DNS colorimetric | Primary driver of Maillard browning. High reducing sugars = darker fries/snacks, shorter fry oil life | >3.5%: increased browning risk for customers producing fried products |
| **Protein (% DM)** | Kjeldahl (N × 6.25) | Minor but relevant for nutritional labeling and Maillard reactivity | Values outside expected range may require nutritional label adjustment |
| **Ash (% DM)** | AOAC 923.03 (muffle furnace) | Mineral content indicator. High ash may indicate soil contamination or high mineral water | >5.0% DM: investigate soil/residue issue |
| **SO₂ Residue (mg/kg)** | Modified Monier-Williams | Preservative for color retention. Must meet regulatory limits of destination country | >400 mg/kg: may violate EU/China regulations; >10 mg/kg requires label declaration in US |

### 3.3 Microbiological Properties

| Parameter | Analytical Method | What It Tells the Buyer | Red Flags |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **APC (CFU/g)** | ISO 4833-1 | General hygiene indicator. Low count = good process sanitation | >1 × 10⁵ CFU/g: marginal shelf life; investigate process hygiene |
| ***Salmonella* (/25g)** | ISO 6579-1 | Critical pathogen. Zero tolerance in most markets | Detection triggers immediate recall evaluation |
| **Yeasts & Molds** | ISO 21527-1 | Storage stability indicator. >500 CFU/g may signal moisture ingress or packaging failure | >1 × 10³ CFU/g: increased spoilage risk during transport/storage |

### 3.4 Functional Properties

| Parameter | Analytical Method | What It Tells the Buyer | Red Flags |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Rehydration Ratio (g/g)** | HJ-QA-025 (70°C, 5 min) | Core functional parameter. Determines yield in mashed potato reconstitution and water binding in formulations | <7.0: poor water absorption; may require recipe reformulation by buyer |

## 4. How COA Data Guides Buyer Procurement Decisions

### 4.1 Lot Acceptance Decision Matrix

Buyers should evaluate COAs against a three-tier decision framework:

| Criterion | Green — Accept | Yellow — Conditional | Red — Reject |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| All parameters within spec | ✓ | — | — |
| 1–2 minor parameters marginally outside spec (e.g., color b\* = 23.5 vs. ≤22.0) | — | Accept with deviation agreement or discounted price | — |
| Any pathogen positive (Salmonella, confirmation required) | — | — | **Reject immediately** |
| Moisture > 9.0% | — | — | **Reject** |
| SO₂ > regulatory limit for destination | — | — | **Reject** |
| RR < 6.0 | — | — | **Reject** |

### 4.2 Trend Analysis for Strategic Buying

The most sophisticated buyers track COA data over time to build supplier performance profiles:

| Metric | Calculation | Signal |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Cpk (Process Capability Index)** | (USL − μ) / 3σ or (μ − LSL) / 3σ (whichever is smaller) | Cpk ≥ 1.33 = capable process; 1.0–1.33 = marginally capable; <1.0 = process improvement needed |
| **Ppk (Process Performance Index)** | Same formula using overall standard deviation | >1.67 = excellent supplier; customer audits likely low priority |
| **Standard Deviation (σ)** of key parameters | Across the last 20+ lots | Lower σ = more consistent supplier; enables tighter customer spec |
| **Z-Score** for each parameter | (Individual value − Batch mean) / σ | |Z| > 2: outlier lot; investigate |

Example — Cpk analysis for 25 consecutive lots of Standard Flakes:

| Parameter | Target | USL | LSL | Mean | σ | Cpk | Rating |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----|------|---|-----|--------|
| Moisture (%) | 7.0 | 8.0 | 6.0 | 6.9 | 0.35 | 1.05 | Marginal |
| RR (g/g) | 7.5 | — | 7.0 | 7.7 | 0.15 | 1.56 | Excellent |

## 5. Batch Consistency Evaluation

### 5.1 Within-Lot Variability

For each production lot, Hongji tests 3 composite samples (beginning, middle, and end of the run). The within-lot coefficient of variation (CV) is reported:

$$CV = \frac{\sigma_{within-lot}}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%$$

| Parameter | Typical CV (%) | Acceptable CV (%) | Alert CV (%) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Moisture | 1.0–2.0 | ≤3.0 | >3.0 |
| Reducing Sugars | 2.0–5.0 | ≤8.0 | >8.0 |
| Rehydration Ratio | 1.5–3.0 | ≤5.0 | >5.0 |
| Bulk Density | 1.0–2.5 | ≤4.0 | >4.0 |

### 5.2 Between-Lot Variability (Rolling 20-Lot Window)

Hongji's internal target for between-lot CV is ≤5% for all critical parameters. A rolling window of the last 20 lots is continuously monitored.

Monthly reports showing between-lot trends are available upon request for qualified customers.

## 7. Common Customer Questions About COA Data

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "My lab's result differs from the COA — which do I trust?" | Inter-laboratory variation is normal (up to ±5% for chemical parameters, ±0.5 log for microbiological). Hongji participates in FAPAS proficiency testing (avg. z-score = 1.3). Discrepancies > ±10% should trigger a joint investigation. |
| "Can you add tests to the COA?" | Yes. Custom COA formats can be arranged during contract negotiation. Additional tests may incur a fee. |
| "Do you provide a COA for each pallet?" | Standard: one COA per production lot (up to 20 MT). For contracts requiring per-pallet COAs (e.g., pharmaceutical-grade food ingredients), add a surcharge. |
| "How long after production is the COA available?" | Within 24 hours (standard) or within 2 hours (eCOA portal). |
