## 1. Introduction

The quality of potato flakes and powder is overwhelmingly determined by raw material quality at the point of processing. Of all factors, **reducing sugar content** is the single most critical parameter — it directly governs Maillard browning during thermal processing and therefore final product color, the primary visual quality attribute valued by customers worldwide.

In storage, potato tubers undergo complex biochemical transformations that progressively degrade processing quality. Hongji Agriculture maintains a comprehensive quality preservation program that monitors, models, and mitigates these changes. This document presents the technical basis for that program: the mechanisms of quality deterioration, monitoring methodologies, reconditioning interventions, and early-warning threshold systems.

## 2. Reducing Sugar Dynamics in Storage

### 2.1 The Cold Sweetening Mechanism

Cold sweetening — the accumulation of reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) at sub-ambient storage temperatures — is the most consequential quality change affecting processing potatoes. It occurs via a well-characterized biochemical cascade:

**Trigger:** Low temperature (below 10°C) inhibits mitochondrial respiration, causing an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates.

**Pathway:**

```
Starch
  │
  ▼ (Amylase/Starch phosphorylase)
Maltose / Glucose-1-Phosphate
  │
  ▼ (Amylase activity continues at low temperature)
Glucose + Fructose-6-Phosphate
  │
  ▼ (Hexokinase preferentially forms G6P; F6P accumulates)
Fructose-6-Phosphate → Fructose (via phosphatase)
  │
  ▼
▲ GLUCOSE (primary) and FRUCTOSE (secondary) — ACCUMULATED
```

The key molecular mechanism involves the breakdown of **starch** into soluble sugars via:
1. **Starch phosphorylase** — catalyzes phosphorolytic cleavage of starch → G1P
2. **β-Amylase** — hydrolyzes starch → maltose (remains active at 4–10°C)
3. **Acid invertase** — cleaves sucrose → glucose + fructose (activated by cold stress)
4. **UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase** — supports continued hexose phosphate turnover

At storage temperatures of 7–10°C, the balance shifts from starch synthesis (favored at warmer temperatures) toward starch degradation and sugar accumulation.

### 2.2 Temperature Dependence of Sweetening

The rate of reducing sugar accumulation follows an inverse Arrhenius relationship in the range 4–15°C:

| Storage Temperature (°C) | RS Accumulation Rate (mg/g/month) Atlantic | RS After 6 Months (mg/g) | Relative Sweetening Rate |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 4 | 0.038 ± 0.005 | 0.34–0.42 | 1.00 (baseline) |
| 6 | 0.030 ± 0.004 | 0.28–0.36 | 0.79 |
| 8 | 0.022 ± 0.003 | 0.22–0.30 | 0.58 |
| 10 | 0.015 ± 0.003 | 0.16–0.24 | 0.39 |
| 12 | 0.010 ± 0.002 | 0.12–0.20 | 0.26 |
| 15 | 0.008 ± 0.002 | 0.10–0.18 | 0.21 |

*Hongji data, 2023–2025, Atlantic cultivar, initial RS 0.10–0.13 mg/g.*

**Frost Danger:** If tuber temperature drops below 0°C, freeze damage ruptures cell walls, releasing vacuolar enzymes. The resulting hexose spike can exceed 5 mg/g — rendering potatoes completely unsuitable for flake processing.

### 2.3 Differential Response by Cultivar

| Cultivar | Cold Sweetening Susceptibility | Critical Temperature (°C) | RS at 7°C × 6 mo (mg/g) | Recommended Storage Temp (°C) |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Atlantic | Moderate-High | 2.5 | 0.30–0.35 | 8.0–9.5 |
| Shepody | High | 2.8 | 0.35–0.42 | 7.0–8.5 |
| Russet Burbank | Moderate | 2.0 | 0.25–0.30 | 7.5–9.0 |
| Favorita | Low | 1.5 | 0.18–0.25 | 6.0–8.0 |
| Cooperation 88 | High | 3.0 | 0.38–0.48 | 8.0–10.0 |

### 2.4 Sucrose as Early Indicator

Sucrose is a sensitive early-warning indicator of cold stress. Sucrose levels rise within 48 hours of a cold-temperature event, typically 2–3 weeks before reducing sugars show a significant increase.

| Storage Condition | Baseline Sucrose (% FW) | Sucrose After Cold Stress (7 days) | RS Response (14 days after stress) |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Stable 8°C | 0.18–0.28 | 0.20–0.30 | No change |
| Drop to 4°C for 48 h | 0.18–0.28 | 0.35–0.55 | Increase of 0.02–0.04 mg/g |
| Drop to 2°C for 48 h | 0.18–0.28 | 0.50–0.80 | Increase of 0.05–0.10 mg/g |
| Recovery to 8°C (7 days after cold) | — | 0.25–0.40 | Partial reversion (50–70%) |

**Operational Recommendation:** If sucrose exceeds 0.45% in routine weekly sampling, initiate reconditioning protocol immediately (see Section 7).

## 3. Dry Matter Loss During Storage

### 3.1 Loss Components

Dry matter loss in storage occurs through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Respiratory consumption** — starch converted to CO₂ and H₂O:
   - Formula: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + 2,820 kJ/mol glucose
   - 1 kg dry matter respired releases approximately 1.6 kg CO₂ and 15.7 MJ of heat

2. **Translocation to sprouts** — stored reserves mobilized to support sprout growth:
   - A 1 cm sprout consumes approximately 30–50 mg of tuber dry matter
   - Multiple sprouts at post-dormancy accelerate loss 3–5× vs. unsprouted tubers

### 3.2 Monthly Dry Matter Deterioration Data

The following data represent Hongji's empirical measurements from the 2024–2025 storage season (Atlantic, 8°C, 90% RH):

| Storage Month | Mean DM (%) | DM Loss (Cumulative %) | Respiration Rate (mg CO₂·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹) | Sprouting Status |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Harvest (Oct) | 21.8 | 0.0 | 7.2 | Dormant |
| November | 21.6 | 0.9 | 6.8 | Dormant |
| December | 21.4 | 1.8 | 6.5 | Dormant |
| January | 21.2 | 2.8 | 6.2 | Dormant |
| February | 20.9 | 4.1 | 7.0 | Dormancy break begins |
| March | 20.6 | 5.5 | 7.8 | Apical sprout < 1 mm |
| April | 20.3 | 6.9 | 8.5 | Apical sprout 1–3 mm |
| May | 19.9 | 8.7 | 9.5 | Multiple sprouts |
| June | 19.5 | 10.6 | 10.8 | Heavy sprouting |

**Key Observations:**
- Approximately 60% of DM loss occurs in the second half of the storage period
- Each percentage point of DM loss corresponds to approximately 1.8% lower flake yield
- The inflection point at Month 5 (February–March) coincides with natural dormancy release
- Sprout suppression (CIPC or ethylene) reduces DM loss by 30–50% from Month 5 onward

### 3.3 Minimization Strategies

| Strategy | DM Loss Reduction | Implementation | Cost Impact |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Optimize RH (90–95%) | 15–25% | High-pressure fogging system | +CNY 3–5/ton-month |
| Precise temperature (±0.5°C) | 10–15% | PID control upgrade | Capital (ROI 2–3 years) |
| Ethylene sprout suppression | 30–40% | Ethylene generator | +CNY 3–5/ton-month |
| CO₂ management (< 1,500 ppm) | 5–10% | CA or ventilation optimization | +CNY 2–8/ton-month |
| Gentle handling (reduce bruising) | 5–8% | Drop height < 30 cm, padding | Minimal |

## 4. Tuber Firmness and Freshness

### 4.1 Firmness as a Freshness Indicator

Tuber firmness (measured as the force required to penetrate the periderm and flesh) correlates strongly with turgor pressure, cell wall integrity, and ultimately the crispness/texture of processed flake. Hongji uses a TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Stable Micro Systems) with the following protocol:

- **Probe:** 8 mm diameter stainless steel cylinder
- **Test speed:** 2 mm/s
- **Penetration depth:** 15 mm
- **Sample:** 10 tubers per cell, equatorial region, peel intact
- **Measurements:** Peak force (N), gradient (N/mm), area under curve (N·mm)

### 4.2 Firmness Deterioration Over Storage

| Storage Month | Atlantic (N) | Shepody (N) | Russet Burbank (N) | Comments |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Harvest | 95 ± 8 | 88 ± 7 | 102 ± 9 | Maximum turgor |
| 1 month | 92 ± 7 | 85 ± 6 | 98 ± 8 | Slight water loss |
| 2 months | 89 ± 7 | 82 ± 6 | 95 ± 8 | |
| 3 months | 86 ± 6 | 79 ± 6 | 92 ± 7 | |
| 4 months | 82 ± 6 | 75 ± 5 | 88 ± 7 | Dormancy break approaching |
| 5 months | 78 ± 5 | 70 ± 5 | 84 ± 6 | Visible softening |
| 6 months | 74 ± 5 | 65 ± 5 | 79 ± 6 | Reduced processing crispness |
| 7 months | 69 ± 5 | 60 ± 5 | 74 ± 6 | Marginal for premium flake |
| 8 months | 64 ± 4 | 55 ± 4 | 69 ± 5 | Acceptable only for standard powder |

**Threshold Limits:**
- Ideal processing range: ≥ 80 N
- Acceptable range: 65–80 N (requires modified processing parameters)
- Critical limit: < 55 N — reject for human consumption grade

### 4.3 Relationship Between Firmness and Processing Performance

| Firmness Range (N) | Flake Texture Score (1–10) | Water Uptake (g/g flake) | Rehydration Time (min) | Slurry Viscosity (cP) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ≥ 90 | 9.2 | 5.2 | 3.0 | 450 |
| 80–89 | 8.5 | 5.5 | 3.2 | 420 |
| 70–79 | 7.3 | 5.9 | 3.6 | 380 |
| 60–69 | 6.1 | 6.4 | 4.1 | 340 |
| < 60 | 4.5 | 7.2 | 5.0 | 280 |

*Texture score: 1 = mushy, 10 = perfectly crisp rehydrated flake. Consumer panel data, n = 120, 2024.*

## 5. Storage Effects on Processing Suitability

### 5.1 Flake Color as the Primary Quality Metric

Flake color, measured as L* (lightness), a* (red-green), and b* (yellow-blue) on the CIELAB scale, is the most critical finished-product specification for B2B customers. The primary driver of color deterioration is **non-enzymatic browning (Maillard reaction)** between reducing sugars and free amino acids during drying.

| Storage Duration | L* Value | a* Value | b* Value | Acceptability for Premium Export | Assigned Grade |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| 0–2 months | 88–92 | −1.5 to −0.5 | 18–22 | Approved (all markets) | Premium (A) |
| 3–4 months | 85–88 | −0.5 to 0.5 | 20–24 | Approved (most markets) | Standard (B) |
| 5–6 months | 82–85 | 0.5–1.5 | 22–26 | Restricted (China domestic only) | Standard (B) |
| 7–8 months | 78–82 | 1.5–3.0 | 24–28 | Rejected for export, marginal domestic | Grade C |
| > 8 months | < 78 | > 3.0 | > 28 | Rejected for food use | Grade D (non-food) |

**Customer Color Specifications:**
- Japan market: L* ≥ 86, a* ≤ 1.0, b* ≤ 24
- EU market: L* ≥ 85, a* ≤ 1.5, b* ≤ 25
- USA market: L* ≥ 84, a* ≤ 2.0, b* ≤ 26
- China domestic: L* ≥ 82, a* ≤ 3.0, b* ≤ 28

### 5.2 Mechanism: Why Stored Potatoes Produce Darker Flakes

The darkening of flakes from stored potatoes is the direct result of increased reducing sugar concentration:

```
Higher reducing sugars (glucose + fructose)
         │
         ▼
Maillard reaction during drum drying
(160–180°C, 15–30 seconds)
         │
         ▼
Increased formation of:
   • 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
   • Furosine
   • Melanoidins (brown pigments)
         │
         ▼
Lower L* value + Higher a* value = Darker appearance
         │
         ▼
Rejection by customers with strict color specifications
```

**Quantitative Model:** For Atlantic at standard dry-specification (21% DM), the relationship between reducing sugar (RS) and L* value is:

```
L* = 93.2 − 28.5 × RS        (R² = 0.91)

Where:
L* = CIELAB lightness (100 = perfect white)
RS = reducing sugars (mg/g fresh weight)

Example: RS = 0.15 mg/g → L* = 93.2 − 4.3 = 88.9
         RS = 0.35 mg/g → L* = 93.2 − 10.0 = 83.2
```

### 5.3 Viscosity and Texture Changes

In addition to color, storage affects the rheological properties of the finished flake:

| Parameter | Fresh Potatoes | 6-Month Stored | Change | Mechanism |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Peak Paste Viscosity (cP) | 420 | 340 | −19% | Starch depolymerization |
| Cold Paste Viscosity (cP) | 280 | 240 | −14% | Starch granule degradation |
| Gelatinization Temperature (°C) | 63.5 | 65.2 | +1.7°C | Starch crystallinity changes |
| Swelling Power (g/g) | 18.5 | 16.2 | −12% | Reduced starch hydration capacity |
| Solubility Index (%) | 6.2 | 8.8 | +42% | Increased soluble sugars and damaged starch |
| Flake Bulk Density (g/mL) | 0.32 | 0.36 | +12.5% | Particle morphology changes |

## 6. Reconditioning Protocol

### 6.1 Principle

Reconditioning (also called warm-up or sweat-off) is the controlled warming of stored potatoes to convert accumulated reducing sugars back to starch, thereby restoring color quality. The process exploits the temperature sensitivity of starch-sugar interconversion enzymes.

**Biochemical Basis:** At temperatures of 12–18°C:
- Starch synthase activity increases → promotes starch resynthesis
- Acid invertase activity decreases → less sucrose cleavage
- Respiration shifts toward sugar consumption
- Net result: reducing sugars decrease by 30–60% over 2–4 weeks

### 6.2 Standard Reconditioning Protocol (Hongji Standard)

| Phase | Duration | Temperature | Airflow | RH | Target Outcome |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Ramp 1** | 24 h | Raise 1°C | Continuous, 12 m³·h⁻¹·ton⁻¹ | 90% | Initial warming |
| **Ramp 2** | 3–5 days | Raise 0.5°C per day to 12°C | Continuous | 85–88% | Gradual transition |
| **Hold 1** | 7–14 days | 12°C ± 0.5 | Intermittent, 8 cycles/day × 45 min | 85–88% | Primary sugar reduction |
| **Ramp 3** | 2–3 days | Raise 0.5°C per day to 15°C | Continuous | 85% | Final warming |
| **Hold 2** | 3–7 days | 15°C ± 0.5 | Intermittent | 85% | Final sugar reduction |
| **Pre-Delivery Cool** | 12 h | Lower to 12°C | Continuous | 85% | Processing inlet temperature |

**Total duration: 14–28 days (cultivar and condition dependent)**

### 6.3 Efficacy by Cultivar

| Cultivar | Initial RS (mg/g) | After 14 days at 12°C | After 21 days at 15°C | Final RS (mg/g) | Reduction (%) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Atlantic | 0.35 | 0.22 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 49% |
| Shepody | 0.40 | 0.28 | 0.24 | 0.24 | 40% |
| Russet Burbank | 0.32 | 0.18 | 0.14 | 0.14 | 56% |
| Atlantic (severe) | 0.55 | 0.38 | 0.32 | 0.32 | 42% |

**Note:** Reconditioning is most effective when initiated before reducing sugars exceed 0.40 mg/g. Beyond this point, the metabolic shift is incomplete and residual sugars remain elevated. Potatoes with RS > 0.60 mg/g rarely recover to Grade A spec even with extended reconditioning.

### 6.4 Limitations and Risks of Reconditioning

| Risk | Mechanism | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Weight loss acceleration | Increased respiration at higher temperature | Limit reconditioning to ≤ 21 days |
| Sprout activation | Warm temperature triggers meristematic growth | Apply ethylene (2–5 ppm) during reconditioning |
| Pathogen development | Warmer conditions favor Fusarium, Pectobacterium | Reduce RH to 85%; inspect daily |
| Non-uniform reconditioning | Temperature gradient within cell | Ensure adequate airflow; max pile height 5 m |
| Irreversibility after senescence | Tubers > 7 months in storage show limited response | Early identification; do not recondition late-season stock |

### 6.5 Decision Matrix for Reconditioning

| Storage Month | RS Level (mg/g) | Recondition? | Duration | Expected L* Recovery |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1–4 | < 0.25 | No | — | — |
| 1–4 | 0.25–0.35 | Optional | 7 days | +2–3 L* units |
| 5–7 | 0.30–0.45 | Recommended | 14–21 days | +3–5 L* units |
| 5–7 | 0.45–0.60 | Required | 14–28 days | +4–6 L* units |
| 8+ | < 0.40 | Optional if RS okay | 14 days | +2–3 L* units |
| 8+ | > 0.50 | Do not recondition | — | < +2 L* units, not economical |

## 7. Quality Alert Threshold System

### 7.1 Three-Level Alert Architecture

Hongji operates a **traffic-light alert system** that triggers progressively stronger interventions as quality parameters approach critical limits:

| Alert Level | Color | Definition | Action Required | Communication |
|------------|-------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Green** | 🟢 | All parameters within ideal range | Normal monitoring | None |
| **Yellow** | 🟡 | One or more parameters approaching warning threshold | Increase monitoring frequency; prepare intervention | Cell owner notified |
| **Orange** | 🟠 | Parameter(s) at intervention threshold | Initiate corrective action; daily monitoring | Quality manager notified |
| **Red** | 🔴 | Parameter(s) at critical limit | Emergency intervention; escalate | VP Quality notified; processing cease-risk review |

### 7.2 Quality Parameter Thresholds

| Parameter | Green (Ideal) | Yellow (Caution) | Orange (Intervene) | Red (Critical) | Action on Red |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Reducing Sugars (mg/g) | ≤ 0.25 | 0.25–0.35 | 0.35–0.45 | > 0.45 | Initiate reconditioning; re-test after 7 days |
| Dry Matter (%) | ≥ 20.5 | 19.5–20.5 | 18.5–19.5 | < 18.5 | Blend with high-DM stock; lowest priority processing |
| Tuber Firmness (N) | ≥ 85 | 70–85 | 55–70 | < 55 | Expedite to processing; reduce heat input |
| Sprout Length (mm) | 0 | 0–2 | 2–5 | > 5 | Immediate sprout control reapplication |
| Weight Loss (%) | < 3 | 3–5 | 5–7 | > 7 | Investigate RH and airflow; expedite processing |
| Internal Temperature (°C) | Setpoint ± 0.5 | ± 0.5–1.0 | ± 1.0–2.0 | ± > 2.0 | Full system diagnostics; mobile backup cooling |
| CO₂ (ppm) | < 1,500 | 1,500–2,500 | 2,500–4,000 | > 4,000 | Increase ventilation; scrubber activation |
| Decay (% by count) | 0 | < 0.5 | 0.5–1.5 | > 1.5 | Manual sorting; fungicide treatment; isolate |

### 7.3 Weekly Quality Scoring System

Each storage cell receives a weekly quality score:

```
Quality Score (0–100) = Σ (Parameter Indicators)

Where each parameter contributes:
- 100 × weight if in Green
- 75 × weight if in Yellow
- 50 × weight if in Orange
- 0 × weight if in Red
```

| Parameter | Weight | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Reducing Sugars | 0.30 | Most important for flake color |
| Dry Matter | 0.25 | Determines yield and texture |
| Firmness | 0.15 | Freshness and texture indicator |
| Sprouting | 0.10 | Sprout control efficacy |
| Decay | 0.10 | Disease pressure |
| Weight Loss | 0.05 | Economic loss indicator |
| CO₂/Internal Temp | 0.05 | Environmental health |

**Scoring Example (Cell A-03, March 2026):**

| Parameter | Value | Zone | Parameter Score | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|------|----------------|----------|
| Reducing Sugars | 0.32 mg/g | 🟡 Yellow | 75 | 22.5 |
| Dry Matter | 20.2% | 🟡 Yellow | 75 | 18.75 |
| Firmness | 78 N | 🟡 Yellow | 75 | 11.25 |
| Sprouting | 0.5 mm | 🟢 Green | 100 | 10.0 |
| Decay | 0.3% | 🟢 Green | 100 | 10.0 |
| Weight Loss | 3.8% | 🟡 Yellow | 75 | 3.75 |
| CO₂ | 1,200 ppm | 🟢 Green | 100 | 5.0 |
| **Total Score** | — | — | — | **81.25** |

**Interpretation:** Score 81/100 → Good condition. Continue monitoring. Begin reconditioning planning for late April production window.

### 7.4 Trend-Based Alert

In addition to absolute thresholds, Hongji uses **rate-of-change alerts**:

| Parameter | Maximum Acceptable Rate of Change | Alert Trigger |
|-----------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Reducing Sugars | +0.02 mg/g per week | > 0.03 mg/g in 2 consecutive weeks |
| Dry Matter | −0.2% per month | > 0.3% in a single month |
| Firmness | −3 N per month | > 5 N decline in one month |
| Weight Loss | +0.5% per month | > 0.8% per month for 2 consecutive months |
