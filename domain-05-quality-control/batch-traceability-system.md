## 1. Introduction

Traceability is a fundamental pillar of Hongji Agriculture's quality and food safety management system. In the event of a quality incident, regulatory inquiry, or customer complaint, Hongji must be able to trace any finished product lot back to its raw material origins — including the specific farm field, seed variety, harvest date, and processing conditions — and trace forward to every customer shipment. This document describes the complete batch traceability system, including the coding architecture, information system support, traceability performance metrics, and mock recall procedures.

Hongji's traceability system is designed to meet the requirements of:

- **ISO 22000:2018** — Clause 7.1.6 (Traceability system)
- **FSSC 22000** — Additional requirement for traceability and food fraud prevention
- **EU Regulation 178/2002** — General Food Law, Article 18 (Traceability)
- **China Food Safety Law** — Article 42 (Traceability requirements)
- **Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)** benchmarked standards
- **Customer-specific traceability requirements** (e.g., one-up/one-down, full chain)

## 2. Traceability Coding Architecture

### 2.1 Lot Number Structure

Hongji's lot number is a 22-character alphanumeric code structured to encode the maximum amount of traceable information within a compact identifier.

```
Format:  HJ - XX - YY - ZZZZZZ - DD - N

Example: HJ - AT - R2 - 260715 - 01 - A
```

| Segment | Position | Length | Code | Meaning |
|---------|----------|--------|------|---------|
| **Company Prefix** | 1–2 | 2 letters | HJ | Hongji Agriculture |
| **Variety Code** | 3–4 | 2 letters | AT | Atlantic |
| | | | SH | Shepody |
| | | | RB | Russet Burbank |
| | | | YS | Yanshu (domestic variety) |
| | | | OT | Other (specified in internal system) |
| **Production Base / Field** | 5–6 | 2 characters | R2 | Zhangbei Base, Field Block 2 |
| | | | S4 | Shangyi Base, Field Block 4 |
| | | | K1 | Kangbao Base, Field Block 1 |
| | | | T3 | Tengnapo Base, Field Block 3 |
| | | | PL | Plant / Processing facility code (if rework) |
| **Production Date (YYMMDD)** | 7–12 | 6 digits | 260715 | 2026-07-15 |
| **Production Line** | 13–14 | 2 digits | 01 | Processing Line 1 |
| | | | 02 | Processing Line 2 |
| **Shift / Sub-Lot** | 15 | 1 letter | A, B, C | Shift A (06:00–14:00), B (14:00–22:00), C (22:00–06:00) |

**Example Full Breakdown:**

```
Lot: HJ-AT-R2-260715-01-A

AT = Atlantic variety
R2  = Zhangbei Base, Field Block 2
260715  = Produced 15 July 2026
01  = Processing Line 1
A   = Shift A (morning shift)
```

### 2.2 Additional Identifiers

## 5. Traceability Performance Metrics

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Definition | Target | Actual (2025) |
|-----|------------|--------|----------------|
| **T1 — Backward Trace Time** | Time to trace from finished product to raw material source (field level) | ≤4 hours | 3.2 hours avg |
| **T2 — Forward Trace Time** | Time to trace from finished product to all customer delivery points | ≤8 hours | 5.5 hours avg |
| **Trace Success Rate (1 step)** | % of trace exercises achieving one-step traceability (finished product → production batch OR raw material → processing line) | 100% | 100% |
| **Trace Success Rate (Full chain)** | % of trace exercises achieving full end-to-end traceability (finished product → seed lot and finished product → all customers) | ≥95% | 98% |
| **Data Completeness** | % of required data fields populated for a given lot | 100% | 99.6% |
| **Label Accuracy** | % of barcode scans matching database records | ≥99.9% | 99.94% |

### 5.2 Measurement Methodology

Trace times are measured using stopwatch from the moment the traceability team receives the request until the requested information is documented in a traceability report:

- **Backward trace (T1):** Start with a finished product lot number. End when the specific field block and seed lot are identified.
- **Forward trace (T2):** Start with a raw material receipt ID or an intermediate WIP number. End when all customer shipments containing that material are identified.

## 6. Mock Recall Procedure

Hongji conducts a minimum of **two mock recalls per year** as a regulatory and certification requirement (FSSC 22000, ISO 22000). These exercises validate the effectiveness of the traceability system under simulated crisis conditions.

### 6.1 Mock Recall Process Flow

```
Step 1 — Trigger (QA Director selects random lot)
        │
Step 2 — Notification (QA team notified; clock starts)
        │
Step 3 — Backward Trace (→ field level)
        │
Step 4 — Forward Trace (→ all customer shipments)
        │
Step 5 — Data Compilation (traceability report generated)
        │
Step 6 — Verification (independent QA auditor verifies data accuracy)
        │
Step 7 — Debrief (lessons learned, CAPA if needed)
        │
Step 8 — Report (submitted within 5 working days to COO and certification body)
```

### 6.2 Mock Recall Scenario Examples

| Exercise | Date | Scenario | Result |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
