## 1. Introduction

The chemical composition of potato flakes and potato powder directly determines functional performance in the customer's application — texture, water absorption, browning behavior, and nutritional value. Accurate and reproducible chemical analysis is essential for process control, product specification compliance, regulatory adherence, and customer confidence.

This document describes the standardized analytical methods employed at Hongji's chemical laboratory for the determination of dry matter, starch, reducing sugars, sucrose, protein, ash, crude fat, crude fiber, and sulfite residues. All methods are validated against international reference methods (AOAC, ISO, AACC, GB) and participate in quarterly inter-laboratory proficiency testing programs (FAPAS / BIPEA). Method performance parameters (repeatability, reproducibility, LOD, LOQ) are provided for each key analyte.

## 2. Dry Matter Content

Dry matter (DM) content is the single most important compositional parameter in the potato flake industry. It determines yield efficiency in processing and the water-binding capacity of the final product. In the raw tuber, DM ranges from 18–26% (fresh weight); after dehydration, target DM in flakes is 92–94%.

### 2.1 Reference Method — Air Oven Drying (AOAC 934.06)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **AOAC Reference** | AOAC Official Method 934.06 (Moisture in Dried Fruits) — adapted for potato flakes |
| **Apparatus** | Forced-air oven (Memmert UF-110 or equivalent), ±1.0°C temperature accuracy, calibrated quarterly |
| **Sample Weight** | 5.0 ± 0.1 g (ground to pass 1 mm sieve if particle D50 >2 mm) |
| **Container** | Aluminum weighing dish with tight-fitting lid, pre-dried (103°C, 2 h) and tared |
| **Drying Temperature** | 103 ± 2°C |
| **Drying Time** | 16–18 hours (overnight) or to constant weight (±0.003 g change after an additional 2 h drying) |
| **Cooling** | Desiccator with active silica gel or molecular sieve desiccant, minimum 30 min cooling |
| **Weighing** | Analytical balance (0.0001 g resolution); weigh immediately after cooling to avoid moisture re-adsorption |

**Calculation:**

$$Dry\ Matter\ (\%) = \frac{m_{after\_drying}}{m_{initial}} \times 100$$

$$Moisture\ (\%) = 100 - Dry\ Matter\ (\%)$$

**Correction Factor for High-Fat Samples:**

If crude fat content exceeds 3% DM (not typical for potato products but relevant for specialty formulations), a correction factor is applied to account for volatile fat oxidation products lost during drying:

$$DM_{corrected} = DM_{measured} + 0.15 \times Fat\ (\%\ DM)$$

### 2.2 Rapid Method — Halogen Moisture Analyzer (Production QC)

For in-process control and rapid release decisions, Hongji uses a halogen moisture analyzer (Mettler Toledo HB43-S or Sartorius MA37).

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Sample Weight | 3.0 ± 0.5 g |
| Drying Temperature | 105°C (standard program), 130°C (fast program for in-process samples only) |
| Drying Endpoint | Automatic — weight change <1 mg per 30 seconds |
| Typical Duration | 8–12 minutes (standard); 4–6 minutes (fast) |
| Correlation Check | Calibrated against reference oven method weekly; r² ≥ 0.995; max allowed bias ±0.2% absolute |

**Calibration Protocol:**

1. Each Monday, run 5 representative samples on both the halogen analyzer and the reference oven method.
2. Perform linear regression: DM_oven = a × DM_halogen + b
3. If slope (a) deviates from 1.000 by more than ±0.02, or intercept (b) exceeds ±0.3, the halogen analyzer is serviced and recalibrated.
4. Store the current calibration coefficients in LIMS and apply automatically.

### 2.3 Near-Infrared (NIR) Rapid Analysis Method

For high-throughput screening of incoming raw tubers and intermediate process streams, Hongji employs a Fourier-Transform NIR analyzer (Bruker Matrix-F or FOSS DS2500).

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Instrument** | FOSS DS2500 (reflectance mode) or Bruker Matrix-F |
| **Wavelength Range** | 1100–2500 nm (full spectrum) |
| **Spectral Resolution** | 2 nm |
| **Sample Presentation** | Rotating cup (50 mm diameter), filled uniformly to 15 mm depth |
| **Measurement Time** | 30 seconds per sample |
| **Calibration Model** | PLS (Partial Least Squares) regression, 100+ calibration samples |
| **Calibration Update** | Every 6 months, with min. 20 validation samples |

**NIR Calibration Performance for Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | R² (Calibration) | R² (Cross-Validation) | RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction) | SEC (Standard Error of Calibration) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Dry Matter (%) | 0.992 | 0.985 | ±0.35% | ±0.25% |
| Total Starch (% DM) | 0.978 | 0.965 | ±1.2% | ±0.9% |
| Reducing Sugars (% DM) | 0.961 | 0.948 | ±0.15% | ±0.10% |
| Protein (% DM) | 0.985 | 0.975 | ±0.25% | ±0.18% |

**Validation Protocol per ASTM E1655:**

1. Collect NIR spectra and reference (wet chemistry) values for a minimum of 20 validation samples quarterly.
2. Calculate bias = mean(reference − NIR). Bias must be ≤ ±0.3% for dry matter.
3. Calculate SEP (Standard Error of Prediction) = √(Σ(reference − NIR)² / (n−1)). SEP must be ≤ 0.5% for dry matter.
4. If bias or SEP exceeds limits, the model is recalibrated with expanded sample sets.

### 2.4 Dry Matter Calculation Formula with Correction Factors

$$DM_{report} = DM_{measured} \times F_{hygroscopic} \times F_{volatiles}$$

Where:
- **F_hygroscopic** = Correction for moisture re-adsorption during cooling. Standard factor = 1.000 (with desiccator in good condition). If desiccator silica gel is >50% saturated (color change indicators on blue gel), F = 1.002 to compensate.
- **F_volatiles** = Correction for volatile organic compounds lost during drying. Standard factor = 1.000 for potato flakes. For samples with added volatile flavorings, F = 1.005–1.015 depending on formulation.

### 2.5 Acceptance Limits

| Product Type | Moisture (%) | Dry Matter (%) | Test Method for Release |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Potato Flakes (Standard) | 6.0–8.0 | 92.0–94.0 | Halogen (verified by oven weekly) |
| Potato Flakes (Fine) | 5.5–7.5 | 92.5–94.5 | Halogen (verified by oven weekly) |
| Potato Powder (Standard) | 6.5–8.5 | 91.5–93.5 | Halogen (verified by oven weekly) |
| Potato Powder (Fine) | 6.0–8.0 | 92.0–94.0 | Halogen (verified by oven weekly) |
| Raw Potato Tubers | 74–82% | 18–26% | NIR (rapid) — verified by oven daily |

*Note: Contractual moisture specifications may be tighter per customer requirements.*

## 3. Starch Content

Starch is the dominant component of potato dry matter (typically 70–80% of DM in flakes). The starch content, gelatinization degree, amylose/amylopectin ratio, and level of starch damage all control the rehydration characteristics and final product texture.

### 3.1 Method — Ewers Polarimetric Method (ISO 10520 / EU 2009/90/EC)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Reference** | ISO 10520: Determination of starch content — Ewers polarimetric method |
| **Principle** | Acid hydrolysis of starch to soluble sugars followed by polarimetric measurement of optical rotation |
| **Sample Weight** | 2.50 ± 0.01 g (ground to <500 μm) |
| **Hydrolysis** | 30 min at boiling with 25 mL 1.128 M HCl (density 1.0189 g/mL at 25°C) |
| **Filtration** | Through fluted filter paper (Whatman No. 4); discard first 10 mL of filtrate; ensure filtrate is completely clear |
| **Clarification** | If filtrate is colored or turbid, add 1–2 mL of Carrez I (K₄[Fe(CN)₆]·3H₂O, 150 g/L) and Carrez II (ZnSO₄·7H₂O, 300 g/L) solution, filter again |
| **Polarimeter Reading** | Saccharimeter or polarimeter with sodium D-line (λ = 589 nm); 200 mm tube; constant temperature at 20.0 ± 0.5°C |
| **Reference Rotation** | [α]D for potato starch in 1.128 M HCl = +185.2° (at 20°C) |

**Calculation:**

$$Starch\ (\%) = \frac{\alpha \times 2000}{[\alpha]_D \times L \times m}$$

Where:
- α = polarimeter reading (angular degrees)
- [α]D = specific rotation of potato starch in HCl = +185.2°
- L = tube length (200 mm = 2.0 dm)
- m = sample mass (g)
- 2000 = combined factor for dilution and conversion

**Interference Correction:**

If sucrose content exceeds 2% of sample, a separate sucrose determination must be performed and the result subtracted from the apparent starch content:

$$Starch\ (corrected)\ (\%) = Starch\ (apparent) - Sucrose \times 0.9$$

### 3.2 Starch Gelatinization Degree (DG)

The degree of starch gelatinization (DG) is a critical quality attribute for instant potato flakes, directly correlating with rehydration performance.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Method** | Enzymatic / amyloglucosidase method (modified AACC 76-13) |
| **Principle** | Amyloglucosidase (AMG) selectively hydrolyzes gelatinized starch to glucose. Measure glucose released before and after complete cooking of the same sample. The ratio gives DG |
| **Enzyme** | Amyloglucosidase from *Aspergillus niger* (Megazyme E-AMGDF or equivalent), ≥300 U/mL |
| **Buffer** | Sodium acetate buffer, 100 mM, pH 4.5 |
| **Glucose Assay** | Glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOD-POD) reagent, measured at 510 nm |

**Procedure:**

1. **Raw (uncooked) digest:** 100 mg sample + 5 mL buffer + 0.1 mL AMG → 40°C, 20 min. Stop with 10 mL ethanol. Centrifuge. Measure glucose in supernatant.
2. **Total (cooked) digest:** 100 mg sample + 5 mL buffer → boil 30 min → cool → add 0.1 mL AMG → 40°C, 20 min. Stop with 10 mL ethanol. Centrifuge. Measure glucose in supernatant.

**Calculation:**

$$DG\ (\%) = \frac{Glucose\ (raw\ digest)}{Glucose\ (cooked\ digest)} \times 100$$

**Acceptable Range:**

| Product Grade | DG Target (%) | Action if Outside Range |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Premium Flakes | 88–93 | Adjust blanching time ±30 s |
| Standard Flakes | 85–92 | Adjust drum speed ±0.5 RPM |
| Economy Flakes | 82–90 | Acceptable; review if <80% |
| Powder | 80–88 | Adjust milling intensity |

### 3.3 Starch Damage Measurement (AACC 76-31)

Mechanical starch damage during milling and sieving affects water absorption and can cause undesirable stickiness.

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Reference** | AACC Approved Method 76-31 (Spectrophotometric Method) |
| **Principle** | Damaged starch granules are more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by α-amylase. The glucose released is measured colorimetrically |
| **Enzyme** | α-Amylase from *Bacillus subtilis* (Megazyme or equivalent) |
| **Reagent** | Glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOD-POD) |
| **Calculation** | Starch damage (%) = Glucose (mg) × 0.9 / Sample mass (mg) × 100 |

**Interpretation:**

| Starch Damage (%) | Category | Effect on Rehydration | Action |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| <3 | Low | Clean texture; normal water absorption | No action needed |
| 3–5 | Acceptable | Slightly faster hydration but still good texture | No action needed |
| 5–8 | Moderate | Noticeably faster hydration; slightly sticky | Reduce milling speed or increase sieve aperture |
| >8 | High | Pasty texture; excessive stickiness; high WSI | Immediate investigation and corrective action |

### 3.4 Amylose / Amylopectin Ratio (ISO 6647)

| Russet Burbank | 23–26 | 74–77 | High dry matter; preferred for industrial dehydration |
| Innovator | 20–23 | 77–80 | Lower amylose → slower retrogradation → better shelf life |
| Agria | 22–25 | 75–78 | Balanced; widely used in European processing |

**Effect on Processing:**

| Amylose Content | Retrogradation Rate | Gel Strength | Freeze-Thaw Stability | Best Use |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| 20–22% (low) | Slow | Weak | Excellent | Frozen products, soups |

| **Indicator** | Methylene blue, 1% (w/v) in ethanol |
| **Principle** | Reducing sugars reduce Cu²⁺ to Cu₂O (brick-red precipitate) in hot alkaline solution. The endpoint (last trace of blue) is detected visually |
| **Titration** | Pre-mix equal volumes (10 mL each) of A and B, add 50 mL water and 10 mL sample extract. Heat to boiling, titrate while boiling with additional sample extract until blue color disappears |
| **Endpoint** | Blue → brick-red (should disappear within 15 s of last addition) |

**Comparison: DNS vs. Fehling's**

| Aspect | DNS Method | Fehling's (Lane-Eynon) |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Precision (RSDr) | ±2.5% | ±4.0% |
| Subjectivity | None (spectrophotometric) | Operator-dependent (visual endpoint) |

## 7. Sulfite (SO₂) Residue

Sulfur dioxide is added during processing (typically at the blanching or washing stage) as a color preservative (anti-browning agent) and antimicrobial. Residual levels must be controlled to meet both regulatory limits and customer specifications.
